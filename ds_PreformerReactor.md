## Prereformer Reactor Surrogate Model

### Description
The surrogate model of a prereformer reactor was loaded in a rigorous process simulator (CHEMCAD). Sensitivity analysis compared the rigorous simulation of the unit operations with the surrogate model. The dataset has the surrogate model in HDF5 format (*.h5 file) and a presentation (PDF) that describes the task and explains the learnings.
