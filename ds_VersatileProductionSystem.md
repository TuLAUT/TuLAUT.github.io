## Versatile Production System

### Description
The VPS consists of several modules, starting with the delivery of material to be packaged (corn), storage of the material, dosing, filling, production (producing popcorn).
Delivery: Here, the corn is delivered as raw material and is transported to the storage of the plant. The corn is transported via conveyor belt in a Stainless steel funnel, from where a pressure conveyor transports the corn to the storage module.
Storage: The storage module is a container. If there is a certain amount of corn in the storage module and a certain amount of storage capacity in the dosing module (next module), the corn will be transported pneumatically to the dosing module through a pipe.
Dosing: This module transport a pre-defined amount of corn to the supply module. Therefore, a load cell in combination with a dosing screw are used to transport the correct amount of corn pneumatically to the filling module.
Filling: The filling module fills the corn into small bottles. The bottles are positioned with the help of a rotary table to the different processes:
Cleaning: Blow compressed air into the bottle to clean it (Slot 2).
Portioning: Fill bottle with corn (Slot 3).
Put on the lid: Using a pneumatically gripper to put the lid on the bottle (Slot 5).
Screw on the lid: Using a pneumatically gripper to screw the lid on the bottle (Slot 7).
Quality control: A camera controls if the lid is correctly screwed on the bottle and if there is the correct amount of corn in the bottle.
After all processes are finished, the filled bottle will be transported to the production module.
Production: The production module produces popcorn by blowing heated air from below through a glass cylinder containing the dosed corn portion. The increased volume of the popcorn then causes it to rise and leave the glass cylinder through a ramp going one of two ways. It is first filled up into a cup until the weight of the cup exceeds a hard coded limit. Finally, a switch is activated, routing the rest of the popcorn into a separate excess-container.
