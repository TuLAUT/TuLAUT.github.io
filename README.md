## Welcome to TuLAUT on GitHub

TuLAUT (Theory and Teaching of Automation Technology) is an initiative of university professors in Germany who research and teach in the field of automation technology. What they have in common is that they consider complex technical processes and plants from the point of view of how automation solutions can be designed and implemented for them using suitable methods and which descriptive means and tools can support these methods.

The common goal is to develop methods that can be applied to real, complex, often not formally described engineering tasks of automation engineering practice, be it for automation in machines, process or production engineering plants, in energy generation and distribution, in buildings, vehicles or traffic systems.

### Available Datasets

Here on this page we have a curated list of data sets which have been used and/or generated by members of the TuLAUT group. We distinguish the data by sets by task (anomaly detection (supervised & unsupervised), diagnosis, planning, product monitoring, production optimization). Have a look on the individual page of a data set for more information about it and how to use it.
