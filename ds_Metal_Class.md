## Metal classification based on prompt gamma neutron activation analysis

### Description
Metals can be recycled an infinite amount of times under suitable conditions. An increase
on the percentage of recycled metals without loss of quality is possible, if the recycling
material is well-known before the remelting process and impurities are extracted.
The prompt gamma neutron activation analysis (PGNAA) investigates complex metals
nondestructively and yields detailed information on the elemental composition. Part of
this challenge is to see whether the analysis can be done quickly, to allow recycling on
an industrial scale. PGNAA excites the material using neutrons, which create a gamma
emission with a specific intensity. Those intensities are measured by a gamma spectrom-
eter.
The current hackathon is motivated by the project "MetalClass". A real time classifica-
tion on the basis of the PGNAA-spectrum is the aim of the challenge.
