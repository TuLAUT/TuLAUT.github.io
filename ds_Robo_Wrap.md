## Partitioning and clustering of wrapping and laminating profile geometries

### Description
Point clouds of different profiles are to be partitioned, i.e. cut into contour sections of the
same or different lengths. Then, these sections of all profiles are to be compared with each
other and clustered. Once the clusters of sections have been formed, it is possible to describe
profiles not only unspecifically as a giant point cloud, but with the help of a few discrete
clusters that are present in the contour.
