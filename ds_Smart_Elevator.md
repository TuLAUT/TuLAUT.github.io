## Smart elevator positioning

### Description
In areas such as logistics and manufacturing, certain movement patterns can often be
identified in the transport routes. The time spent on the transport routes can be reduced by
adapting the circumstances (e.g. means of transport). In cases, where elevators are included
in the transport route, one option would be to reduce waiting time by better positioning the
elevator. In this challenge we focus on that task.
The goal is to analyse the movement bahavior of a freight elevator and predict its positions.
Later, these predictions can be used to better position the elevator and save waiting time.
You will be provided with historic data records of the past three years. The records contain
the following information
