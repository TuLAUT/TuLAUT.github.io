## Time series prediction on data from PCB production

### Description
In the file furnace_blanked.csv are excerpts, which were removed from the original fur-
nace data set. In addition, gaps were inserted afterwards, which appear in regular
intervals and are always two minutes long. The gaps are characterized by the fact that
they have a value of -13.37. Additionally, zeros have been inserted after the gaps to
prevent data from the future being used. The goal is to predict the original values of the
gaps as best as possible. The source code as well as the completed furnace_blanked.csv
file with the filled gaps must be submitted.
