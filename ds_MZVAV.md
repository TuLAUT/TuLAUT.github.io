## Data Sets for Evaluation of Building Fault Detection and Diagnostics Algorithms

### Description
This documentation and dataset can be used to test the performance of automated fault detection and diagnostics algorithms for buildings. The dataset was created by LBNL, PNNL, NREL, ORNL and ASHRAE RP-1312 (Drexel University). It includes data for air-handling units and rooftop units simulated with PNNL's large office building model.
