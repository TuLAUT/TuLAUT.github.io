## SLIDe: Steam Line Intrusion Detection Benchmark

### Description
SLIDe (Steam Line Intrusion Detection Benchmark) benchmark is devoted to the analysis of diagnostic algorithms for the detection and isolation of process faults and the detection of cyberattacks for a simulated fragment of the steam line of a fluidized bed boiler including the third and fourth stage of superheaters. It includes challenging scenarios including sensor, actuator, and technological components faults as well as cyber-attacks. To reflect the industrial nature of the benchmark, participants will only have a qualitative description of the process with a list of measurements and a few archival datasets representing different operating conditions, but only for fault-free and attack-free states.

The 2-stages steam line superheaters simulator models the processes within the boiler of a power unit. In each of these sections there is an attemperator, a superheater and a cascade controller - the main controller controls the temperature of the steam after the superheater, while the auxiliary controller, which controls the injection water valve, controls the temperature after the cooler.
