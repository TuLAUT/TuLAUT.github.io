## An Experimental Comparison of Anomaly Detection Methods for Collaborative Robot Manipulators

### Description

This dataset poses as a comprehensive benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in CPS.
The dataset describes a state-of-the-art collaborative robot. 
The authors drive an extensive experimental campaign comprising 600 runs under normal operation, and 80 runs where exogenous perturbations are present. 
Data is collected on the robotâ€™s joints, force-torque readings, and the time spent in each program node.
