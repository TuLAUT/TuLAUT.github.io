## Liersch 506 Lower Thread Rotation

### Description
This repository contains data generated with a Liersch 506 automatic sewing machine equipped with a lower thread sensor system.

The data is split into two numpy arrays, one for normal sewing operations and one for anomalous sewing operations. Each row represents a completed stitching and each column a single stitch.

With the data folder being the active directory, the data files can be loaded using numpy as follows.

```
import numpy as np

normal = np.load('normal-3436x86.npy')
anomalous = np.load('anomalous-206x86.npy')
```
