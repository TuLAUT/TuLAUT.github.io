## Electrical current prediction for a production system

### Description
The challenge is based on data of a door frame production. The main device of this process is
the engine of milling cutter. Before milling, each door frame is clamped. The milling cutter is
then extended to the working position and moved along the Y-axis depending on the required
groove. Then the working position is left and the starting position is approached again. The
motivation is to model the system behavior using data of the machine and additional sensors.
