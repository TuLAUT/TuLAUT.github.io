## Parking space prediction

### Description
For the considered road section of the Echternstra√üe in Lemgo, data on the changes in
occupancy of the parking spaces from 01.09.2019 to 31.12.2019 are available. Furthermore,
the initial occupancy of the parking spaces on 01.09.2019 at 0:00h (Coordinated Universal
Time, UTC) is available.
The AI-Challenge task is to predict the parking behaviour for a period of time from
01.01.2020 to 29.02.2020. For this period of time, it is to be predicted how many parking
spaces are occupied on the hour. The results are to be entered in the prepared file
Prognosis.csv, which is to be submitted as the solution to the task. In addition to the data
provided, any other information sources may be used (e.g. information on the day of the
week or weather data).
