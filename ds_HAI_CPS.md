## HAI-CPPS: The Hamburg AI Benchmark for Cyber-Physical Production Systems

### Description
The Hamburg AI Benchmark for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (HAI-CPPS) is a comprehensive dataset designed for evaluating AI models in the domains of anomaly detection, diagnosis, and reconfiguration for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS).

HAI-CPPS is structured as a benchmark comprising ten different scenarios of a modular process plant, each demonstrating various functionalities and complexities. This enables you to comprehensively test your algorithms not only on a single use-case, but systematically across increasingly complex examples within the same domain. Each scenario can feature multiple anomalies occurring within a single module or across multiple modules of the CPS.
