## LUMEN (Liquid Upper stage demonstrator Engine) Benchmark

### Description
This benchmark covers some challenging problems of fault diagnosis of safety-critical technical systems. During the operation of rocket engines, sensors, such as pressure transducers, thermocouples and flow meters, are subjected to high thermal and mechanical stresses and are therefore susceptible to potential failure. To prevent engine damage during testing, maximum and minimum thresholds (redlines) are defined for sensors measuring critical parameter, for example the rotational speed of the turbopump or the combustion chamber pressure. If those thresholds are exceeded, a safe shutdown of the engine is initiated. Faulty sensors can therefore cause an unnecessary test abort and thus additional costs. In addition, rocket engines are operated at physical limits and therefore susceptible to failures of components which most likely result in a catastrophic event. The diagnosis system needs to identify faulty sensors and components as fast and accurately as possible to potentially reduce the cost and prevent catastrophic failures. Additionally, misclassifications and missed faults can also result in catastrophic failures.
